# Office Scrubber

* An automated script to uninstall, remove and scrub Office 2016 MSI and Office Click-to-Run (2016, 2019, 365)

* Office (2016, 2019, 365) all share the same installation location and licensing level, which may lead to licenses confliction or duplication

* Additionally, if you uninstalled Office normally on Windows 8/8.1/10, the licenses will be left installed in the system SPP token store

* If you intend to remove Office and start clean, this script will help you in that
